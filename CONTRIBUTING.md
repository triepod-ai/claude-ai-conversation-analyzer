# Contributing to Claude AI Conversation Analyzer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Claude AI Conversation Analyzer! This is a portfolio project showcasing advanced AI/ML engineering capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project serves as a professional portfolio demonstration of:
- Advanced semantic search and vector database integration
- High-performance conversation processing (398.4 conv/sec)
- Modern web application development with AI/ML components
- Production-ready system architecture and DevOps practices

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-ai-conversation-analyzer.git
cd claude-ai-conversation-analyzer

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run tests
pytest

# Start the application
python demo/app.py
```

## 📝 Code Style

### Python Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Example Code Style
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def process_conversations(
    conversations: List[Dict[str, str]], 
    chunk_size: int = 1200
) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """Process Claude AI conversations into searchable chunks.
    
    Args:
        conversations: List of conversation dictionaries
        chunk_size: Maximum size for each chunk
        
    Returns:
        List of processed conversation chunks
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If conversations list is empty
    """
    if not conversations:
        raise ValueError("Conversations list cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    return processed_chunks
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_search.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage for core modules
- Integration tests: API endpoints and workflows
- Performance tests: Verify processing speed benchmarks

## 📊 Performance Standards

### Benchmarks to Maintain
- Conversation processing: ≥398.4 conversations/second
- Search response time: <500ms average
- Memory usage: <2GB for large datasets
- Error rate: 0% (zero tolerance for processing errors)

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
python tests/performance/benchmark_processing.py

# Load testing
python tests/performance/load_test.py
```

## 🔄 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation
- Use appropriate issue templates
- Provide detailed descriptions
- Include relevant performance implications

### 2. Branch Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Create bugfix branch  
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

### 3. Commit Standards
```bash
# Use conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add semantic search caching"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in chunker"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
git commit -m "perf: optimize vector search performance"
```
